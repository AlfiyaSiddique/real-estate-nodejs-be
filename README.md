Me and my coding buggy Tihomir are making Real Estate Application. The idea behind this application is to make application where 
users and brokers can meet. We want to train our coding skills. Here we are writing the back end of the application, using NodeJS and ExpressJS.

You can start the project on local with few easy steps:

- you have to clone the repository
- you have to write on the terminal "npm install" (you need to have Node installed on your system)
- start the back end "npm start"
